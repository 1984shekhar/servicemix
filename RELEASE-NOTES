                      Apache ServiceMix 5.0.2
                  ================================
Overview
--------

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that unifies the
features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, and Karaf into a powerful
runtime platform you can use to build your own integrations solutions.

This is a new minor release of the project, which contains a few bug fixes. We also
downgraded the version of Apache Karaf to 2.3.4 to avoid a known issue in the 2.3.5 version.
Apache ServiceMix 5.0.2 includes:

- Activiti 5.15.1 (http://www.activiti.org)
- Apache ActiveMQ 5.9.0 (http://activemq.apache.org)
- Apache Camel 2.12.3 (http://camel.apache.org)
